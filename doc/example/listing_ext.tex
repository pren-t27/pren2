\section{Listing from an external file}
Source code can also be included from an external file. This has the advantage 
that the Documentation is always in sync with the Source code. It is also 
possible to include only specific lines. If you use this feature, make sure to 
check the line numbers every time you change the source file. \\
Example for this document, this time with LaTeX syntax:
\lstsettinglatex
\lstinputlisting[firstline=1, lastline=5]{../example/example.tex}    % Include 

\subsection{Code}
\lstsettinglatex                    % Setting up for LaTeX highlighting
\lstinputlisting{listing_ext.tex}   % Include external file listing_ext.tex
